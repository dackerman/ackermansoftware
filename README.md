# Ackerman Software
## Projects list for David Ackerman

This is the source code behind ackermansoftware.com. It describes some
of the packages I have on Github in more detail than is normally in
the README, such as why I created it and screenshots.

The site is compiled from projects.js, which lists out each
project's information, and links to the images and markdown file
describing it. It then generates some simple static HTML in a standard
format for upload to any webserver.

### Usage

1. `npm install` Installs dependencies
1. `npm start` Recompiles the site into the dist/ folder.
