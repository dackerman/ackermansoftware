					101 Goals in 1001 Days

					<p>It all started when I read an article from <a href="http://www.blog.swetavajjhala.com/?p=387">Sweta Vajjhala's blog</a> about how to track your goals. The idea is that you come up with 101 things that you want to accomplish in about two years.  You write those goals down, then come up with a list of tasks for each goal.  The first task in each goal should be something you can take action on <em>right now</em>, so that you could pick from any goal on any day and start making progress on it.</p>

					</a>
					<p>The main problem with this idea, is that you will presumably have a list of 101 things that you can do <em>now</em>.  It can be hard to keep track of what task goes to what goal and how to organize those goals into overarching themes. So, I did what any good hacker would do, make his own!</p>
					<p>The application allows you to create a list of goals, and link each one to a "Category" that the goal falls into. When you look at your goals, you can then see each goal neatly indented under the category it is in. When you start filling out each task for the goal, you can set it as "current", which means it will go into your master task list. The task list then shows you all your current tasks, which you can complete by selecting "done".</p>
					<p>I made this app in python/Django with a SQLite DB backing it. It just runs on my local machine. However, I like to see my Goals and tasks while on the go, so I made a special mobile-version that allows me to see goals and tasks from my Nexus S.</p>

					Dackdroid Game Engine

					<p>This project is a 2D Game engine built specifically for android games. I have always been very interested in video game engines, but only recently have had any idea how to actually build one. I still don't, but I had some ideas about how I would go about it - especially after reading about the great talks from 
					<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-62tRHLcHk">Chris Pruett</a>
					about Android game development.</p>
					<p>This application features two threads, one that renders the scene, and one that executes the game logic. The rendering thread gets frequently blocked by IO, so it's advantageous to have the game thread allowed to do some processing while the rendering thread displays the last image. I use double buffering, which both allows me to keep the game screen from flickering, but also allows me to build up the next frame of animation on the game thread while the rendering thread displays the last one.</p>

					<p>The engine utilizes a tile system to render the screen, and uses a SurfaceHolder to actually do the drawing. The tiles can be any size, and infinitely tiled in the case of ground or grass. The rendering system doesn't use OpenGL, as I didn't want to lose the opportunity for being compatible on multiple platforms.</p>
					<p>There is also a rudimentary camera system that currently can be controlled by the GameThread. If desired, the user of this library could control the camera X and Y position with the touchscreen, allowing the user to drag the camera around to view the world.</p>
