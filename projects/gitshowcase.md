Git showcase, located at [gitshowcase.com](http://gitshowcase.com), is
a website that is meant to show a developer's major projects front and
center, and help them to expose all the cool work they are doing.

GitHub itself works pretty well for just showing the list of projects
that someone is working on, but it doesn't necessarily order them with
the biggest one a the top, and doesn't really show good statistics
about the project in relation to the developer working on it.

Git showcase is still a work in progress, but what it has so far is a
mechanism for determining how "important" each of a developer's public
projects are, based on commit history (by the developer, and not
others), how recent the project is, and how popular it is (followers,
forks). The site also has icons to show the primary programming
language for each project, and aggregates them at the top so anyone
can see how many programming languages they really know (based on what
kind of code they like to commit).
