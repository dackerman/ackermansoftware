This is just a copy of my `.emacs` file from my workstation. I usually
use emacs for my normal text editing needs, for things such as
javascript, html, css, and python code. Although I love my emacs and
it's keybindings, I am definitely an eclipse guy when it comes to Java
code. There is just no other sane way of editing that stuff!

Also note that I have written at least a little emacs lisp code since
I picked up the program. Although I am pretty familiar with functional
programming languages in general, I am not very familiar with lisp in
particular, so coming up with my own `backward-kill-word` was
definitely a challenge. Also note that I took most of the
`backward-kill-word` code from a post on stackoverflow, so I cannot
claim all the credit for this function.
